## Updating the Templates

This package includes a default-app template with packages referenced from those that are periodically updated in the cloud-carbon-footprint repo. However the local packages are established at create-app time and won't automatically get these updates. For this reason, each time a release is made and Cloud Carbon Footprint package version updates are published, the create-app template should be updated and the changes should be documented along with upgrade instructions in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/cloud-carbon-footprint/cloud-carbon-footprint/blob/trunk/packages/create-app/CHANGELOG.md) file using changesets.
